<!-- This is the pom.xml. This is your configuration file for Maven.
		Maven is a project management tool that will handle your
		dependencies, your compilation, testing, packaging, etc.
		
		The project is divided up into several folders. src/main is where the
		files belong for the main program. java folder is where the java files
		go and resources is where the resources for the main program go.
		
		inside src/test is where you put all the java files associated with testing
		and where you will put the resources for your tests. The src folder is not
		important right now, but will be when we move into servlets and war projects.
		
		the target folder is where all the compiled classes, the reports, the packaged
		jar file, etc. will go when maven finishes with them.
		
		Maven has a build lifecycle
			default (build)			clean		site
				used for building	used for	used generating
				the program			getting		a documentation site for your project
									rid of everything
									in the 
									target folder
									
									
		default phases
			verify
			compile
			test-compile
			test
			package
			install
			deploy
		each phase has individual goals where the phase is essentially broken up
			into granular steps.
			
		How to use maven
			mvn package			package the application
			mvn test			run the tests
			mvn clean package	delete the target folder and run the package phase
